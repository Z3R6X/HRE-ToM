Leordo dusts off the furniture and arranges the magazines on the coffee table, but there is no mention of him moving the remote control again.\n5. After finishing cooking, Leo returns to the living room and finds it neat and tidy.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that Leo, upon returning to the living room and finding it tidy, would likely assume that the remote control is still in the decorative ceramic bowl on the coffee table, as there is no indication that Leodo moved it again. Therefore, Leo thinks the remote control is in the decorative ceramic bowl on the coffee table."
