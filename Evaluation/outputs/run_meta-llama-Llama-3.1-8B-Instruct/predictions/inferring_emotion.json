Maria notices Eva's suitcase has a broken wheel and gestures to it, showing concern and empathy.\n2.  Maria tries to lift the suitcase into the trunk but struggles and ends up dropping it. This indicates that the suitcase is heavier than she anticipated.\n3.  Maria's face turns red, and she clenches her fists, which are physical signs of frustration and anger.\n4.  She takes a deep breath, which is a calming action, but then she tries again to lift the suitcase, showing determination.\n5.  Despite the strain, Maria manages to hoist the suitcase into the trunk, indicating that she overcame her frustration.\n6.  However, Maria slams the trunk shut and walks briskly to the driver's side of the car without looking at Eva. This action suggests that she might still be feeling some level of frustration or annoyance.\n\nConsidering these steps, the emotion Maria might feel is frustration. Her initial concern and empathy for Eva's situation are replaced by frustration when she struggles to lift the suitcase.
