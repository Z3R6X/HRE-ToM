Emilia would assume that the black marker is still in the whiteboard's tray, as that's where she left it."

Lukn\u0117 returns to the library with her coffee.\n\nGiven these steps, we can infer that Lukn\u0117 thinks the book is still in the library because she left the library to grab a cup of coffee and returned to the library afterwards. She wouldn't think the book is in Noah's backpack or on his laptop, as those are not locations she is aware of at that moment. Therefore, Lukn\u0117 likely thinks the book is on the library shelf where Noah moved it."
