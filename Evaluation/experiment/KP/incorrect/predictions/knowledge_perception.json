After changing the channel, he places the remote control in a small basket on the side table. Mariya excuses herself to go to the kitchen to prepare some snacks. Muhammad moves the remote control from the small basket on the side table to a drawer in the TV stand. Muhammad then starts tidying up the living room, arranging the magazines on the coffee table and fluffing the cushions on the couch. Mariya returns to the living room, carrying a tray of snacks and drinks. Muhammad helps her to set the snacks on the coffee table and then resumes his task of tidying up the living room.",

Muhammad picks up the remote control to turn on the television and changes the channel. Muhammad places the remote control in a small basket on the side table. While tidying up, Muhammad moves the remote control from the small basket to a drawer in the TV stand. Mariya is present to witness both the placement of the remote control in the small basket and its subsequent movement to the drawer. Mariya excuses herself to go to the kitchen to prepare snacks. Mariya returns to the living room with snacks and drinks, and Muhammad helps her set them on the coffee table. Since Mariya saw the remote control being moved to the drawer, she would likely believe that the remote control is now in the drawer in the TV stand."

Muhammad places the remote control in a small basket on the side table. Mariya is present when Muhammad places the remote in the small basket, so it is likely she sees where the remote is placed. Mariya leaves the living room to go to the kitchen. While Mariya is in the kitchen, Muhammad moves the remote control from the small basket to a drawer in the TV stand. Mariya did not witness Muhammad moving the remote to the drawer. There is no mention of Muhammad telling Mariya about moving the remote, nor is there any indication that she notices its new location when she returns to the living room. Since Mariya was not informed of the remote’s new location, she would likely believe that the remote control is still in the small basket on the side table, where she last saw it."
